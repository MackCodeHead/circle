# A script that can be invoked to build your system. A good usage would be to
# run unit tests and fail the build if they donâ€™t pass. You may invoke
# another tool such as Maven, Ant, etc. with this script. You may download and
# install any libraries or other programs you feel are necessary to help you
# build your system. (Please list out these dependencies in the README).
